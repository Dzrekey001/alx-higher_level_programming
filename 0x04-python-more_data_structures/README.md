**Python More Data Structure**
***
These are a set of programming tasks that involve working with sets, dictionaries, and other data structures in Python. Each task has a specific objective and requirements. Here's a brief overview of each task:

1. Squared simple:
Write a function that computes the square value of all integers in a matrix.
The function should return a new matrix with squared values while keeping the original matrix unchanged.

2. Search and replace:
Write a function that replaces all occurrences of an element with another element in a new list.
The function should take the initial list, the element to replace, and the new element as input.

3. Unique addition:
Write a function that adds all unique integers in a list, considering each integer only once.
The function should return the sum of the unique integers.

4. Present in both:
Write a function that returns a set of common elements between two sets.
The function should take two sets as input and return a new set containing the common elements.

5. Only differents:
Write a function that returns a set of elements present in only one set.
The function should take two sets as input and return a new set containing the unique elements.

7. Number of keys:
Write a function that returns the number of keys in a dictionary.
The function should take a dictionary as input and return the count of keys.

8. Print sorted dictionary:
Write a function that prints a dictionary by ordered keys.
The keys should be sorted in alphabetical order, and the corresponding values should be printed.

9. Update dictionary:
Write a function that replaces or adds a key/value pair in a dictionary.
The function should take a dictionary, a key, and a value as input and update the dictionary accordingly.

10. Simple delete by key:
Write a function that deletes a key in a dictionary.
The function should take a dictionary and a key as input and remove the key if it exists.

11. Multiply by 2:
Write a function that returns a new dictionary with all values multiplied by 2.
The function should take a dictionary as input and return a new dictionary with the updated values.

12. Best score:
Write a function that returns the key with the highest integer value in a dictionary.
The function should take a dictionary as input and return the key with the highest value.
***
Each task has specific requirements, such as not using import statements and following a particular function prototype. You can find the implementation of each task in the corresponding Python file provided in the GitHub repository mentioned in the task description.
