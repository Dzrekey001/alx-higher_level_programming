##Python Inheritance##

This project focuses on the concept of inheritance in object-oriented programming using Python. It covers various aspects of inheritance, including superclass, subclass, method overriding, multiple inheritance, and more. The goal of this project is to gain a deep understanding of inheritance and its application in Python.
***
**Learning Objectives**
By the end of this project, you should be able to:

1. Explain why Python programming is awesome.
2. Understand the concepts of superclass, baseclass, and parentclass.
3. Define and utilize subclasses in Python.
4. List all attributes and methods of a class or instance.
5. Determine when an instance can have new attributes.
6. Inherit a class from another class.
7. Define a class with multiple base classes.
8. Identify the default class every class inherits from.
9. Override methods or attributes inherited from the base class.
10. Identify which attributes or methods are available to subclasses through inheritance.
11. Understand the purpose and benefits of inheritance.
12. Use built-in functions such as isinstance, issubclass, type, and super in inheritance scenarios.

Files and Directories

0-lookup.py: A Python script that defines a function to retrieve the list of available attributes and methods of an object.

1-my_list.py: A Python script that defines a class MyList, which is a subclass of the built-in list class. It includes a method to print the list in ascending order.

2-is_same_class.py: A Python script that defines a function to check if an object is exactly an instance of a specified class.

3-is_kind_of_class.py: A Python script that defines a function to check if an object is an instance of, or inherits from, a specified class.

4-inherits_from.py: A Python script that defines a function to check if an object is an instance of a class that directly or indirectly inherits from a specified class.

5-base_geometry.py: A Python script that defines an empty class BaseGeometry.

6-base_geometry.py: A Python script that defines a class BaseGeometry with a method area() that raises an exception.

7-base_geometry.py: A Python script that defines a class BaseGeometry with a method area() and a method integer_validator() to validate integer values.

**Testing**
The project includes a tests directory containing text files for each task. You can execute the test cases by running the command python3 -m doctest ./tests/*.

***
**Requirements**
1. Python 3.8.5
2. pycodestyle 2.8.* (for code style enforcement)
3. Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
