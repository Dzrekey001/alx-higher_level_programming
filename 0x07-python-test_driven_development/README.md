**0x07. Python - Test-driven development**
***
**Description**

This repository contains Python scripts and test cases for the 0x07. Python - Test-driven development project. The project focuses on test-driven development (TDD) in Python and includes tasks related to writing tests, documentation, and implementing functions.
***
**Learning Objectives**

1. Understand the benefits of test-driven development
2. Write tests using the doctest and unittest modules
3. Write Docstrings and documentation for modules and functions
5. Handle different data types and edge cases in tests
6. Use basic option flags for creating tests

***
Project Tasks
1. Integers addition
2. Divide a matrix
3. Say my name
4. Print square
5. Text indentation
6. Max integer - Unittest
7. Requirements
8. Python 3.8.5
9 pycodestyle 2.8.*

***
**Usage**

To execute the Python test cases, navigate to the project directory and run the following command:
```shell
python3 -m doctest ./tests/*
```

To execute the unittest for the "max_integer" function, run the following command:
```shell
python3 -m unittest tests.6-max_integer_test

```
