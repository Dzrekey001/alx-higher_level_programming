**Python - Data Structures: Lists, Tuples**
***
This project focuses on lists and tuples in Python. It includes several tasks that aim to improve your understanding and proficiency in using these data structures. The tasks cover a range of concepts and techniques related to lists, tuples, and sequences.

**Learning Objectives**
Upon completing this project, you should be able to explain the following topics without relying on external resources:

1. Why Python programming is awesome
2. Lists and their usage
3. Differences and similarities between strings and lists
4. Common methods for working with lists
5. Using lists as stacks and queues
6. List comprehensions
7. Tuples and their usage
8. Choosing between tuples and lists
9. Understanding sequences
10. Tuple packing and unpacking
11. Using the del statement
12. Project Tasks
***
The project includes the following tasks:

1. Print a list of integers: Write a function that prints all integers in a given list.

2. Secure access to an element in a list: Write a function that retrieves an element from a list based on its index.

3. Replace an element: Write a function that replaces an element in a list at a specific position.

4. Print a list of integers in reverse: Write a function that prints all integers in a list in reverse order.

5. Replace in a copy: Write a function that replaces an element in a list at a specific position without modifying the original list.

6. Remove all occurrences of a character: Write a function that removes all occurrences of the letter 'C' (case-insensitive) from a string.

7. Print a matrix of integers: Write a function that prints a matrix (list of lists) of integers.

8. Add tuples: Write a function that adds two tuples element-wise and returns the result as a new tuple.

9. Return length and first character of a string: Write a function that returns the length of a string and its first character.

10. Find the maximum integer in a list: Write a function that finds the largest integer in a list.

11. Check for multiples of 2: Write a function that checks whether each element in a list is divisible by 2 and returns a new list of Boolean values.
