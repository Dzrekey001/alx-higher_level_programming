##0x0F. Python - Object-relational mapping

**Description**
In this project, I implemented a Python script using both MySQLdb and SQLAlchemy to interact with a MySQL database. The project focuses on Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) and covers the following tasks:

***
#TASK
0. Get all states
Write a script that lists all states from the database hbtn_0e_0_usa.

1. Filter states
Write a script that lists all states with a name starting with 'N' (upper N) from the database hbtn_0e_0_usa.

2. Filter states by user input
Write a script that takes in an argument and displays all values in the states table of hbtn_0e_0_usa where the name matches the argument.

3. SQL Injection...
Enhance the previous script to make it safe from SQL injection.

4. Cities by states
Write a script that lists all cities from the database hbtn_0e_4_usa.

5. All cities by state
Write a script that takes in the name of a state as an argument and lists all cities of that state from the database hbtn_0e_4_usa.

6. First state model
Write a Python script that contains the class definition of a State and an instance Base = declarative_base().

7. All states via SQLAlchemy
Write a script that lists all State objects from the database hbtn_0e_6_usa using SQLAlchemy.

8. First state
Write a script that prints the first State object from the database hbtn_0e_6_usa.

9. Contains a
Write a script that lists all State objects that contain the letter 'a' from the database hbtn_0e_6_usa.

10. Get a state
Write a script that prints the State object with the name passed as an argument from the database hbtn_0e_6_usa.

11. Add a new state
Write a script that adds the State object "Louisiana" to the database hbtn_0e_6_usa.
